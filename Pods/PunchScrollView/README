PunchScrollView hosted on github is a ScrollView framework for iOS (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) which works like the Apple UITableView Framework 

Easy and fast implementation, almost like the UITableView
Use the benefits of the NSIndexPath like you might know it from the UITableView
Easy setup in combination with Core Data
Helpful methods, i.e. jump or scroll to a desired page
Avoid boilerplate code
Save lots of memory with the use of dequeuing

I wrote a mini documentation http://www.cmenschel.de/punchscrollview
>[Update from WWDC 2012] Apple introduced the UICollectionViewController which has the same purpose as PunchScrollView. Because it does the same things I will stop developing PunchScrollView in the near future.[/Update]
